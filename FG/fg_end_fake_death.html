  You tell Albert the truth: you did not come as a visitor—you came to place a name in the news.
  <br><br>
  Albert understands at once. If “Albert” appears as a headline, the place-name will be read.
  Together you stage a death: the sound, the scene, the evidence—enough for the papers to print the name.
  <br><br>
  The mission succeeds and Albert lives, but you both know what this is: not purity, not innocence—
  only violence redesigned into a more complicated structure.

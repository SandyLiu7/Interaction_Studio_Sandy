  You tell Albert the truth and you run with him.
  <br><br>
  You leave the house, but the mission collapses: no headline, no place-name, no clean transmission—
  only pursuit. Every minute becomes another narrowing corridor.
  <br><br>
  Albert could have remained a scholar, a spectator. Now he is inside your timeline,
  carrying your danger with him. You do not know whether the next turn holds an exit or a gun.

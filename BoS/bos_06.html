      <p>
        I thought of keeping the Book of Sand in the space left on
the shelf by the Wiclif, but in the end I decided to hide it
behind the volumes of a broken set of The Thousand and
One Nights. I went to bed and did not sleep. At three or four
in the morning, I turned on the light. I got down the
impossible book and leafed through its pages. On one of
them I saw engraved a mask. The upper corner of the page
carried a number, which I no longer recall, elevated to the
ninth power.

        I showed no one my treasure. To the luck of owning it
was added the fear of having it stolen, and then the
misgiving that it might not truly be infinite. These twin
preoccupations intensified my old misanthropy. I had only a
few friends left; I now stopped seeing even them. A prisoner
of the book, I almost never went out anymore. After studying
its frayed spine and covers with a magnifying glass, I
rejected the possibility of a contrivance of any sort. The small
illustrations, I verified, came two thousand pages apart. I set
about listing them alphabetically in a notebook, which I was
not long in filling up. Never once was an illustration repeated.
At night, in the meager intervals my insomnia granted, I
dreamed of the book.

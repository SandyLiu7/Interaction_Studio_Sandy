       His speculations irritated me. "You are religious, no
doubt?" I asked him.
"Yes, I'm a Presbyterian. My conscience is clear. I am reasonably sure of not having cheated the native when I
gave him the Word of God in exchange for his devilish book."
I assured him that he had nothing to reproach himself for,
and I asked if he were just passing through this part of the
world. He replied that he planned to return to his country in a
few days. It was then that I learned that he was a Scot from
the Orkney Islands. I told him I had a great personal affection
for Scotland, through my love of Stevenson and Hume.
"You mean Stevenson and Robbie Burns," he corrected.
While we spoke, I kept exploring the infinite book. With
feigned indifference, I asked, "Do you intend to offer this
curiosity to the British Museum?"
"No. I'm offering it to you," he said, and he stipulated a
rather high sum for the book.
I answered, in all truthfulness, that such a sum was out of
my reach, and I began thinking. After a minute or two, I came
up with a scheme.
"I propose a swap, " I said. "You got this book for a
handful of rupees and a copy of the Bible. I'll offer you the
amount of my pension check, which I've just collected, and
my black-letter Wicliffe Bible. I inherited it from my
ancestors."
"A black-letter Wicliffe!" he murmured.
I went to my bedroom and brought him the money and
the book. He turned the leaves and studied the title page
with all the fervor of a true bibliophile.

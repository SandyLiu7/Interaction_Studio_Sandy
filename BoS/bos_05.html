       The line is made up of an infinite number of points; the
plane of an infinite number of lines; the volume of an infinite
number of planes; the hypervolume of an infinite number of
volumes. No, unquestionably this is not — more geometrico
— the best way of beginning my story. To claim that is it true
is nowadays the convention of every made-up story. Mine,
however, is true.

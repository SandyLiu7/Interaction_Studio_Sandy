      <p>
        Summer came and went, and I realized that the book
was monstrous. What good did it do me to think that I, who
looked upon the volume with my eyes, who held it in my
hands, was any less monstrous? I felt that the book was a
nightmarish object, an obscene thing that affronted and
tainted reality itself.
I thought of fire, but I feared that the burning of an infinite
book might likewise prove infinite and suffocate the planet
with smoke.

        After a few moments of silence, he said, "I don't only sell
Bibles. I can show you a holy book I came across on the
outskirts of Bikaner. It may interest you."
He opened the suitcase and laid the book on a table. It
was an octavo volume, bound in cloth. There was no doubt
that it had passed through many hands. Examining it, I was
surprised by its unusual weight. On the spine were the words
"Holy Writ" and, below them, "Bombay."
"Nineteenth century, probably," I remarked.
"I don't know," he said. "I've never found out."
I opened the book at random. The script was strange to
me. The pages, which were worn and typographically poor,
were laid out in a double column, as in a Bible. The text was
closely printed, and it was ordered in versicles. In the upper
corners of the pages were Arabic numbers. I noticed that one
left-hand page bore the number (let us say) 40,514 and the
facing right-hand page 999. I turned the leaf; it was
numbered with eight digits. It also bore a small illustration,
like the kind used in dictionaries — an anchor drawn with
pen and ink, as if by a schoolboy's clumsy hand.

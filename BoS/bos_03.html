        Somewhere I recalled reading that the best
place to hide a leaf is in a forest. Before retirement, I worked
on Mexico Street, at the Argentine National Library, which
contains nine hundred thousand volumes. I knew that to the
right of the entrance a curved staircase leads down into the
basement, where books and maps and periodicals are kept.
One day I went there and, slipping past a member of the staff
and trying not to notice at what height or distance from the
door, I lost the Book of Sand on one of the basement's musty
shelves.

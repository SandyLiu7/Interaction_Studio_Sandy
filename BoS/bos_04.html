      <p>
        The stranger asked me to find the first page.
I laid my left hand on the cover and, trying to put my
thumb on the flyleaf, I opened the book. It was useless.
Every time I tried, a number of pages came between the
cover and my thumb. It was as if they kept growing from the
book.
"Now find the last page."
Again I failed. In a voice that was not mine, I barely
managed to stammer, "This can't be."
Still speaking in a low voice, the stranger said, "It can't
be, but it is. The number of pages in this book is no more or
less than infinite. None is the first page, none the last. I don't
know why they're numbered in this arbitrary way. Perhaps to
suggest that the terms of an infinite series admit any
number."
Then, as if he were thinking aloud, he said, "If space is
infinite, we may be at any point in space. If time is infinite, we
may be at any point in time."
